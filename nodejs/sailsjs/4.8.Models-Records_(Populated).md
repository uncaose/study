                      .populate('buyers')  // a "collection" association
                      .populate('seller');  // a "model" association

// this array is a snapshot of the Customers who are associated with the first Order as "buyers"
console.log(orders[0].buyers);
// => [ {id: 1, name: 'Robb Stark'}, {id: 6, name: 'Arya Stark'} ]

// this object is a snapshot of the Company that is associated with the first Order as the "seller"
console.log(orders[0].seller);
// => { id: 42941, corporateName: 'WolvesRUs Inc.' }

// this array is empty because the second Order doesn't have any "buyers"
console.log(orders[1].buyers);
// => []

// this is `null` because there is no "seller" associated with the second Order
console.log(orders[1].seller);
// => null
